# Phone Call Marketing Campaign Prediction using Classification
The main goal of this portfolio is using Classifications. The data is related to direct marketing campaigns (Phone Calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

# Outcome
* Using Ordinal Encoder to convert categorical features to integers and apply the Gaussian Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes to find out their Accuracy and Area Under the Curve on train and test sets.
* Using Discretization and apply Multinomial Naive Bayes to find out the Accuracy and Area Under the Curve on train and test sets.
* Plotting Accuracy and Area Under the Curve bar graphs.
* Using Recursive Feature Estimation (RFE) to eliminate less important features.
* Plotting graph with different number of features to visualise Accuracy and Area Under the Curve with the different number of best features.
